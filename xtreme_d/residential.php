                         <h3><img src="images/leaf3.png" alt="">&nbsp;Trimming Palms and Trees</h3>	
                         <p>Proper pruning can improve the safety, health and appearance of Trees and Palms. Common reasons for pruning include the removal of dead, dying, diseased, over crowded or hazardous branches.</p>
                         <p>There are several ways to care for yours, depending on what they need. Trimming services are used as healthy practices for your trees and should be done annually to maintain their health. When preformed correctly, they can prevent problems, such as stunted or defective growth, over growth, disease, decay, insect infestation, major storm damage and more.</p>	
                         <h3><img src="images/leaf3.png" alt="">&nbsp;Trimming Hedges</h3>
                         <p>New hedges require formative pruning for their first couple of years after planting. Formative pruning is usually carried out in winter or spring.</p>
                         <p>After this, maintenance trimming is carried out, usually once a year for informal hedges and twice a year for formal hedges. Some formal hedges may need three cuts a year. Maintenance trimming is generally carried out between spring and summer.</p>	
                         <h3><img src="images/leaf3.png" alt="">&nbsp;Organic Fertilizer</h3>
                         <p>Natural and organic fertilizers differ from chemicals in that they feed your plants while building the soil. Soils with lots of organic material remain loose and airy, hold more moisture and nutrients, foster growth of soil organisms, and promote healthier plant root development.</p>
                         <p>If only chemicals are added the soil gradually loses its organic matter and macrobiotic activity. As this material is used up, the soil structure deteriorates, becoming compact, lifeless and less able to hold water and nutrients. This results in increased amounts of fertilizer needed to feed plants.</p>				 <p>One of the simplest things you can do to detoxify your lawn, have a beautiful yard, garden, or turf, as well as protect your pets and family is to stop using synthetic-chemical fertilizers that contain fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. While these types of fertilizers can be effective in the short term for achieving the results we all desire for our lawns and gardens, they have been shown to have negative side effects on the environment, on people, and on pets – especially those with sensitivities to synthetic chemicals.</p>			<p>Organic fertilizers can really make a difference in your yard, garden, or turf, producing healthy, vigorous plants and sod. If other cultural conditions (e.g. light, moisture level, soil type and pH, temperature range, etc.) are properly met, these plants and sod will be more lush and disease resistant, and thus less prone to attack by weeds, insects, fungus, bacteria, or viruses than plants that are not properly nourished and whose cultural conditions are not properly met.</p>
                         <p>Most importantly, if you use organic fertilizers, you will help protect the environment while making your yard safer for you and your family and pets.</p>
